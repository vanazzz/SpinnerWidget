Version/Source control is important because it helps keeps track of changes. For instance, one authorized user made changes to Software ABC while another user also did the same thing at the same time. This, in the end, would cause a software system conflict since there are two versions of the software now. Version/Source control addresses these types of issues. They track changes and allow different users to see the most recent version of the code and see the changes that were made.
